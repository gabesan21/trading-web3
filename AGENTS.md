# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

**CRITICAL: Always read `@/openspec/project.md` FIRST** to understand:

- Project purpose and tech stack
- Code conventions and architecture patterns
- Domain context and constraints
- Project structure and folder responsibilities

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
