# Change: Add ARB VORTEX Branded README with CLI Aesthetics

## Why
The current README.md lacks brand identity and visual appeal for the general public. The project needs a professional, eye-catching README that showcases the "ARB VORTEX" brand with CLI-style ASCII art and terminal aesthetics to attract developers and users in the Web3 trading community.

## What Changes
- Rebrand the project from "Trading Web3" to **ARB VORTEX** (Automated Blockchain Vortex)
- Add prominent ASCII art logo for CLI aesthetics
- Restructure README with terminal-style formatting and visual hierarchy
- Add visual badges for tech stack, network support, and build status
- Include terminal-themed code blocks and command examples
- Add ASCII dividers and decorative elements for better readability
- Enhance feature highlights with terminal-style formatting
- Add "Quick Start in 60 Seconds" terminal walkthrough section
- Include visual network compatibility matrix
- Add contribution guidelines with CLI-style formatting

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capability `readme-documentation` 
- Affected code: `README.md` (complete rewrite with branding)
- No breaking changes to functionality
- Improves developer experience and project discoverability
- Establishes brand identity for potential open-source community growth
